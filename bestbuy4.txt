Love the apple 7 45mm watch. I have really small wrists so I though this watch would be too big and awkward. The sports band that it came with is too big and bulky. I actually cut it to make it work but eventually bought a better sports band off amazon and it fits perfect.I am a first time Apple Watch buyer (I have series 7 45mm) and I must say I have no regrets. The watch has exceeded my expectations. I love that it keeps me on track with my daily activity goals. It’s also very lightweight, I forget I have it in. The battery life could be better because I must charge it daily sometimes twice a day, but that’s okay. Overall, I love it and plan on purchasing any series watch to come.Awesome screen area close to edge to edge all around! Upgraded from an Apple Watch 6! There exclusive watch faces that go well with this watch covering almost from edge to edge and make the watch almost having a bigger appearance.Very nice an love the colors an very handy. Love the different watch faces you can pick from an other things you can do.
But it started freaking out on the 7th day when I had it. It told me that I had to restart my watch because it said I tried to many password’s. But I wasn’t even missing with it an it was freaking out when I tried to type the password in.I was skeptical of getting an Apple Watch, but I really like it now. It’s a convenient gadget to have. I’ve bought some extra bands and cover on Amazon to change it up a bit. As you may notice I bought the 44 mm and usually only men but those but I like the bigger screen.Owning a smart watch has never been this amazing! Thank you Best Buy! I got timely updates on my shipment and even though delivery was delayed for a day, the support and communication was spot on.I Iove my Apple Watch I love doing business with youI love this Apple Watch it was a pretty good item the cuality is pretty awesomeExcellent watch stay on all day and never gave me a problemSuper happy with the 7 Series Apple Watch.  I use my watch to track my walks, runs, and bike rides.  Love the redesign and functionality with all of my Apple products.  The battery tends to run down quicker in comparison to older models.Happy with my Apple Watch! Very helpful. The colorFinally moved on from Fitbit. 
If you have an IPhone it’s a no brainer…..I ordered 45mm and it’s so amazing to read anything!Been using Garmin watches for years and will continue for certain activities but decided to try an Apple Watch after getting a new iPhone 13. Really like the design and integration with the phone. Being able to answer your phone and talk is a nice feature when on the go or driving. Love the band and the watch is very comfortable. Battery life is great and simple to charge. No hassle magnetic connection. Don’t have to fiddle with any small plugs. Money well spent!Great watch and price. Very convenient and great fit. I love the large screen and the texting features. I will definitely recommend this watch.Love my very first iPhone watch s7 45 mm Nike sports & love the size of the this watch easy to use!!love love love!I love the apple watches.  I had a Series 3, then a Series 5 now the Series 7.  I love all the features and it really keeps me on track with my exercise.  It is a little bit price as all Apple products are but I have tried other brands and just don’t like them as well. One area where I think it could use improvement is the battery life.The really like the new starlight color which is silver with a slight gold tint.  I upgraded from the Apple Watch 6 and the screen size is significantly bigger which is very useful for viewing maps, emails, text messages and using the new keyboard.Looks great, I love it.. No problem smooth order and deliveryI love the Apple Watch series 7 ! It comfortable has more features than my series 4.

Awesome product with all the needy features, heart rate, ECG, blood oxygen level. I liked it.Very pleased with this purchase, really helps with my exercise.I bought this because my employer requires a fitness tracker in order to get a discount for health insurance. I have used a Fitbit device for more than 10 years. I got the 45 mm Apple Watch because I need reading glasses for small print. The fitness step tracker records about 5% less steps than the Fitbit does. If you need reading glasses there is not a whole lot that you can do with the watch face– – The font is too small to be usable. It’s easy to click into the apps which are readable with a larger font. The integration with the Apple health app on the cloud is excellent. You can answer calls to your iPhone on your watch which is very helpful if you can’t remember where you put your phone. The audio quality is excellent. It’s also helpful for pinging your phone if you can’t remember where are you left it. The vibrating text message function is customizable so that you can be notified of texts from family members if you like. If the watch is synced to your Outlook messages or Calendar you will need to enter a four digit password to unlock the watch to even get a home screen. This happens when you place to watch on your wrist in the morning or remove it during the day. The battery life is just OK. It only charges from an Apple proprietary charger – – it charges quickly but the battery only lasts a day or two – – much shorter than the Fitbit life. The battery charging cords are not cheap. There is one included in the box. You are probably going to need to purchase a second one. The charging cord works best with a high amp USB adapter, which is also an expense. I used the atrial fibrillation app and it works well. You could also make the diagnosis by taking your own pulse. Since it doesn’t have a charging plug-in it’s pretty waterproof. Like any Apple product it works well, it’s very expensive, and you are semi glad you bought it.My husband has never been a watch fan. Any kind of watch (smart or traditional) however I’ve always had both and ever since I’ve been wearing Apple watches I’ve only seen the benefits it could have for my husband as well as myself. I finally took a chance and purchased this for him for Father’s Day. I went with this model because of the larger display and that it was more crack resistant than the other models plus he’s on his feet all day due to his job and I thought he may enjoy seeing his activity. Turns out I was right. He loves it and he said one of the things he enjoys the most is that it’s so light that he doesn’t even notice it. Also now that he’s been wearing it if he forgets it at home (only happened once) he misses it. Apparently he uses it a lot more than he thought he would. I’m very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend.It’s my 3rd Apple Watch. I love it. I have many watches but ever since I started using the Apple Watches, I don’t seem to wear any of the other ones anymore. I love the activity/exercise tracking app. So, many great things about it.  My Apple Watch series 6 started to malfunction. It was not worth fixing for the cost of repair so, I bought a 7 when they dropped in price. I put Apple care on this as well as a protective cover/case on this one.I love the upgrade coming from the 3rd generation. The battery life is a bit longer. WHen I had my generation 3 one the battery would die out when I used my Golf Shot app by the 8th hole. Now I can get through the whole 18, but pretty much running on fumes. The dispay is much bigger too. I can't life without this bad boy!I purchased this to replace my husband’s 3 series Nike watch. He’s enjoying the upgrade, the larger face and it has more features than the 3 he previously owned. I added a screen protector and case to protect the face. It was a great buy.I’ve been an Apple Watch user for many years, I wish I didn’t like them so much but, I do so there it is, been trying to quit for years and years but I just can’t.  Maybe we should start a support group or something.  Anyway, I started with the 1, then the 3 which I really loved and didn’t think would ever be replaced but my wife wanted a 7 and I just couldn’t let her get that far ahead of me so I had to have one.  It is FANTASTIC!  The screen looks huge with the edge to edge bezel change thing they did.  With Covid hangin around the Blood Ox thing gives you a good excuse for getting one if you need a reason.  In all seriousness, everything works perfectly, buy one, you will love it!  Join a support group and we can all try to quit again when the 10 or 15s come outGot this for my birthday. I wanted something to monitor my pulse. It nags at me to walk and stand up. The battery lasts about a day and a half and recharges in 6 hours. It works well with my iPhone 12.Excellent watch!  Much better and clearer picture than my old 4th gen that this is replacing.  Excellent battery, and improved water resistance is key for swimming!  Screen is much more durable too.  I hit it several times and scraped it against things and still no scratches!Great watch , I waited for the iWatch seri8 to come out and wasn’t impressed by it , so I decided to get the series 7 Nike version and I’m glad I did. The watch is awesome and not a bad price.My whole family wears Apple watches. I never really wanted to. After many years I decided to try it and it’s the best purchase I’ve made in a while. While working out I love how it keeps track of my heart rate not to mention everything else it does.I love this watch. I’ve had a gen 1 for years, and I was hesitant to upgrade, but so glad I did. The bigger display is awesome and I love the ability to text on the keyboard. The Nike band and faces are pretty great as well. I love the ability to check my ECG and blood oxygen levels. I work in a hospital and have compared it to legit medical equipment, and I’ve been impressed how accurate it has been. Glad I made the purchase.I have been using the Series 6 watch for quite some time and it had some drawbacks too. This watch has a bigger and better screen with good resolution. I am using this mainly to keep track of my daily exercise routine. Apple can do a little better on their battery but this watch works cool than my previous version. I will definitely recommend.I recently updated my Apple Watch 3 to the 7 because I needed more space and my previous watch had a hard time updating due to that.  The watch overall is great…I love the bigger face however I do wish apple would have a setting to turn off the face when it’s in a downward position.  Besides that I am very happy with my upgrade and would encourage any apple users this is the way to go.Outstanding watch! IMO the best smart watch on the market. Big display and great battery life.Excellent Wearable. I liked all of its features. More accurate sleep tracking results and easily defeats all other smart watches in this segment.Absolutely love this watch when it comes to tracking my fitness. I'm still within 90 days of purchase so I'm still learning and discovering a lot of it's capabilities. I have hesitated in the past on getting one but am extremely delighted I didnt pass on it this time.Switched from the Samsung Frontier watch to this. I don't like the password that I need to put in sometimes if I have not opened my phone in a while and it does not recognize the number I entered. However that could be from the cover I put on it. Speak to text works better than I expected. Didn't bother with that on my old watch. Other than that, it works like it should. Just have to get use to the square screen instead of round.Nike Band is a real nice touch if you're already planning on getting an Apple Watch. Doesn't have too much other Nike stuff besides the extra downloadable watch faces. I was also worried about the 45mm being too big and gaudy but its a great look and makes using the watch easier
Can't believe it took me so long to join the masses - this watch is invaluable in my every day, day to day life!Worth every penny. I have enjoyed this purchase very much. I really wanted the Nike edition, just because I’m a huge Nike and apple fan. I was not disappointed with my purchase, and to top it off the shipping and delivery were excellent!If your that person who’s worried the color of this watch isn’t true black or space grey like the past Apple Watches. I’m here to tell you that I cannot tell the difference, UNTIL! I place it side by side to my old watch. Only then! Can you tell, but barely. I’m happy with my purchase.I originally started with an OG Pebble and went to a Fitbit Versa 2. I love how much more is built into the iwatch than my previous options. I wear mine for work outs and everyday.  I am not a huge fan of the clasp system but it has its purpose. I bought a few leather bands to dress it up some.The display is great and set up was very easy.  It was a replacement for an older model.  Very happy with new features.  The battery life is amazingI took advantage of the Best Buy Father’s Day Sale to upgrade from a series 2 Nike Apple Watch 42mm.  An Apple Rep was on site and very helpful answering my questions.  I purchased the Apple Watch Series 7 Nike Version - a tad larger.  It’s full of features that I never had before and they are incredible.Hear me out. 
Small letters on a tiny watch would one of the reasons I stop using my precious Iwatch. Fast forward 2022 - this sexy beast of a watch is brighter, much more clear letters, and the watch face is not as much as I thought it would be on my wrist. Best decision I had this year.So much faster than my 3!  Just wish my 3 didn't die about a month before the 8's came out.  Was forced to buy the 7 as I use my watch so much for my daily work.Apple Watch 7 is really good, keeps me focusing on the bigger picture. I'm able to handle my notifications without having the need to lift my phone . The next biggest reason why I am happy with this particular variant is because of sleep tracking. To maximize my day-to-day productivity, I need the best quality of sleep. So apps like SleepWatch are a great tool to use to track sleep.Best watch I've ever purchased. It has all the features I need plus more. I like the style and fits just right.First, I love the color. I had another brand fitness watch that I really liked but this one is awesome and I love it. It has all the amenities and syncs to my iPhone perfectly. There is only one thing I think needs improvement, the battery life. I've found myself recharging the watch more often than desired.It’s a really good watch. I’ve had no problems with it!!Was hoping The battery on the 7 would hold a longer charge than the fifth GEN . I like my Garmin watch for my gym workout because The battery lasts five days. Don’t wear Apple Watch Tight or close to the wrist otherwise you’ll hit the dial and I kept getting 911 .
Durability is good !!!!! I Wouldn’t pay full price for the 7 & I wish I didn’t give my 5 away !!!!!Best in tracking my activity & workouts. I also like how I can customize it with different bands. I charge it once a night, and it charges fully from 0 to 100 in under an hour actually!It’s pretty good at recording fitness activities. Also, it can be used for audio calls, checking txts and a bunch of other cool things. 
All the time I get compliments on the band this Nike version comes with.Took me a while to jump on the Apple Watch bandwagon, but I really enjoy wearing it.Love the Nike watch. The band is durable and high quality. The screen is very clear and seems bigger. Speaker is louder and sounds better. Overall it’s a great upgrade from the series 4. Battery life is really good as long as you turn off the always on feature. If you leave it on it will be at 10% bu around 10 pm.Very nice and easy to use Apple Watch. Easy to use and easy to navigate and setup. Easy to change interfaceIt is a great smartwatch, has a lot of sport and useful apps like tracking for your flights, health apps and more.
The battery lasts maximum one day when always on is active, and you will need a cover for the screen, but besides that, it is the best you can get for your ihpone.very beautiful watch with many applications that are used to help improve the wellness and productivity of my day! enjoying all the features and still learning everything this watch as to offer.
Bought for a friend, they love it. Only criticism is keyboard app is still too small to really use comfortable. White Nike band is awesome. Be sure to buy a screen case cover for this expensive item or your screen will get trashed outI love this Apple Watch, is the best smartwatch.I will definitely recommend this watch.This was purchased as a birthday gift for our high school Senior. He absolutely loves it and all the features it comes with. He especially likes using Rings tracker, since he works out daily.Accelerant brand, watch and machine.  This item really helps to keep my health in check.Need to upgrade my series three Apple Watch and did I ever! This watch has so many features that I did not know I needed or wanted. The battery life is phenomenal and the health features are a major improvement. So glad I upgradedDidn't think i would use this watch at all but ended up being my daily must have accessory.Upgraded from a series 4 and love the bigger screen, always on display, and other features. Worthy upgrade.I’ve upgraded from Apple Watch 2nd series to this Nike edition Apple Watch and have no complaints. I opted for Nike edition since I do a lot of physical activities.Apple yesssss great watch I’m liking the features a lot and yes Nike rocks tooIt's an incredible watch. Had a Apple Watch 2 before. This is similar but better because the screen is bigger/sharper. I would say the buttons are less sensitive on the screen and the battery life is worse, but it is doing more stuff so that's OK. The black/black is the coolest.What can I say, it’s Apple! I love my watch, can’t live without it!Great product.  Nice upgrade to the display and response time.  Not the biggest fan of the subtle case color change.Upgraded from an Apple Watch 2 to this 7.  Really like the O2 level reading ability, came in handy when sick.  The face of the watch is a little larger then that of the series 2 which is nice tooAmazing! My brother loved his gift. The product was in good condition and loved the colors they had.Absolutely love my new watch! Thanks so much Best Buy for having it in stock.My 2nd Apple Watch....
Upgraded from Series 5.
What is there nit to like. Longer battery life than the Series 5Great device. Cool features. Would suggest to get the white band though.Definitely the best smart watch. Does a lot of the internal heart rate things that most others don’t. As an older person I feel a little more safe being that I can monitor my heart rate an EKG with this.Idk what to say. It’s Apple. I’m apple all the way around but it’s nonetheless the same product they sale you every yearIt was a gift to me enjoying as l workout sleep etc
Excellent! Super easy to use! Loving it! Must Buy!Great product. I’m glad I have it and wish I got it sooner. I plan on buying moreI thought the watch was a good watch.  However, I'm not an Apple fanatic like most in the world.  It's a nice looking watch though and many of the integrations that Apple does with it's ecosystem are great.  Setup was easy as well.  However,  prefer in comparing this to another smartwatch, I prefer the circle watch face compared to the square.  Also, for some reason, it felt like the band for this one was more difficult and annoying to put on compared to the other.  To be fair, I'm use to Garmin watches and came from the Fenix line.  However, I was comparing this to the Garmin Epix 2 and ultimately went with the Epix.  Many people will like this watch and I think it will satisfy many of the Apple fans.  However, the #1 turn off for me was the battery life.  I don't want another device that I have to charge every day no matter how fast that quick charge may be.  If Apple figures out the battery life, they have a winner, but until then, that will be a big inconvenience for many.  It's nice to be able to go on vacation and NOT worry about another cord to bringI always wanted the Nike edition watch so when Best Buy had them on sale, I finally decided to upgrade my series 2. What a difference 5 generations make.  This thing is so responsive and I love the always on display.This watch is great.  I can track all my exercises, and it tells me the time, lol. I have not had any issues with this watch and i would recommend this to anyone that is looking for an Apple watch.I love my new Apple Watch. I love the exercise app that tracks my activity during the dayAmazing watch, very stylish, lots of features, good battery life.For my first Apple Watch, glad i waited to get this Series 7 and also got a great deal for itLove my series 7 Nike watch. My series 5 shattered so needed a new one.  Like the larger size and bandNice design and light weight compared to other models. If you’re into any fitness then this is the watch for you. Note the face display is changeable so you can personalize it to your style.I like to wear this running. Let's me know how many calories I'm burning.Great watch. The design with Nike symbol is a different look.Best smartwatch available. Does everything a smartwatch should do and performs perfectly.Great product very happy with it and recommend it.perfect for sports and keeping track of your workouts.must have always on display with bright screen.  wish it had sapphire crystal.  big screen easy to see.Great product! The delivery process was quick and easy .Great watch, enjoyed the the Apple Watch SE so I went ahead and upgraded. Main complaint is the curved screen, only screen protectors are film and not glass.I have a apple 6 watch that died on me and needed a new one right away, so I got a 7 watch and will now be bring my new 6 watch back in to get a cover and save for it so I have backup one! Thank you.So far so good lost my series 3 the battery was going out of it and it was time for a new one it was bout 4 to 5 years old so I needed to upgrade it
The best apple watch I've ever owned. The durability of the watch alone makes it worth the upgrade.The Apple Watch 7 Nike edition series is really good. All the new Hr features are quite nice. I would recommend this watch to my family and friends to purchase.Love the watch perfect size and amazing features and advance technology.I can’t live without this watch, I love how big the face is.The rubber wrist band, catches on items. Example (bed sheets) 
When you hold the sheets, somehow it catches and comes loose
when you toss the sheets. I have experienced this twice. You have to be careful when you pickup items, that it dosen't catch. 
The battery doesn't seem to last long, when using apps.
Over all the watch has excellent apps. I am very pleased with it's performance.Awesome product. Great value. Would recommend it.  .Works good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,for realGreat product.I love it would recommend to anybodyMy favorite features are the heart rate monitor and the active minutes! I just wish I didn’t have to charge it every night like all Apple watches.Much more durable then my series 3 that broke in the first month.  Would recommend if you are not careful with the glass.What can one really say about apple watches, they work and work well. The features are great and the connectivity is instantaneous, you will get no issues but you also won't get any compliments either. It's just another apple watch that you'll more than like end up using to only look at texts, control music, use apple pay with and be told to get up and walk around lol. Sadly, the apple watch series whatever is just another apple watch. Oh! but this one is just a little bit larger.Best Watch Ever! By far the best Apple Watch I’ve ever owned.Love the watch it works perfect for me 
Would highly recommendReally good Apple Watch.  Highly recommend.  Great addition.Apple Watch does everything as advertised. I truly enjoy my new watch. It’s a must have for Apple Watch 
Owners. I upgraded from the Apple Watch Series 5. I love this new series Apple Watch!!!!!I love all apple watches especially changing bands and faces to the watch but it’s definitely worth the purchase but if you have a series 6 you might not be any to upgrade the series 7 has a bigger screen but not that much of a difference but I love every 1 of themThis watch is great. All the apps and capabilities are awesome.Great watch. Good upgrade if you have anything older than an apple watch 6.Watch is great wear biking, hiking and working out, as well as the shower just wish the battery life lasted longer than 1 dayI don't normally wear a watch but now I never go any where with out it.
Would be 5 stars except the battery needs to be charged daily. However, fast charging makes this tolerable. Does what it should with a bold bright display. Workouts function well as does gps and heart rate. Find heart rate to be very accurate when compared with chest strap and arm bands.  Even the ecg works. The only problem seems to be that VO2max can only be computed with a walk or run and not cycling.It’s an Apple Watch. What else is there to say. Had one before this and the screen cracked in the corner. Was going to cost more to fix then replace.Series 7 Nike edition is still the best apple watchPerfect anything you can ask for and look for in a smart watch recommend for iPhone usersPurchased this watch when it was on sale. It was super coolThe watch came in Perfect conditions and no issuesMuch faster than my series 4. Battery is probably the same, but the always-on face makes for nicer readability. If there's a downside I've found, it's that the blood O2 sensor seems to read low.This is my first purchase of an Apple Watch and so far I have no regret, it is accurate and has all the necessary applications to help you with your day.Good product, nice look , best performance ,high battery life size………purchased as a gift. Solid gift for anyone !!!!got this for birthday it is much loved. work out app is really good. motivates you to get off the couchMy dream became a reality, pick up an Apple smartwatch. The device is outstanding as many Apple's productThe face on the watch is huge! It's fantastic and super comfy.Very useful features and good for iphone user based on the promotion right now.Super useful I like it you can use it in the pool everywhereGreat watch. Looks nice and has so many features.!Great watch. Love the band, very user friendly OS.GOT IT FOR MY SON , HE LOVES IT , EASY-TO-USE,  YOU COULD A LOT WITH IT , GOOD QUALITYAwesome tech for my 16 yr old boy. He bought it with his first paycheck. So much features. Execelent tool for school, i think.Made the switch from android for the Apple Watch. Loving my 7 so far. Durable, good battery life. Very happy
It’s terrific, just as one would expect from Apple.  I previously had the Apple Watch Nike 3, and this was a pretty substantial leap.Good to use , I have higher version of it and liked it. Good to use , I have higher version of it and liked itAfter using an Apple Watch Series 2 for the past few years, I find new updates and differences on a daily basis. I'm loving this new watch, I'm just sad that one day the series 8 will release with even more stuff...I upgraded from a Nike Series 3 Apple Watch.  It's probably more than I need, I don't think I have used half the features of this watch.  I do like the new faces for it though.  I have local temp, my activity count, and messages at hand so I don't have to take my phone out while teaching.   I really enjoy this upgrade.Awesome upgrade from a series 4. Love this watch. Very satisfiedAwesome!! Watch works well and performs great. Battery life is amazing and the screen it the perfect sizeI really like it, great size and very handy . I recommend it.I bought this watch for my Husband, he absolutely loves it and loves the fact that it is Nike.Apple does it again. The beast Apple Watch I ever purchased, Large and Easy to read display. Much better than my previous Watch 4 44mm. This 45 mm is great for my eye sight. Best Buy sales rep convinced me and took my older model as a trade-in.I bought this Apple Watch 7 for my husband 60 th birthday….I have one and I knew he would enjoy having one also….he loves the way it looks and all the information and data that work on the phone…it said it is crazy all the think you can do with this watch….so happy he love his present.I replaced Apple Watch SE with Watch 7, the new version has slightly larger display, which is significant when compared to the SE model. The watch charges faster as well, takes about 45 to go from 20% to 100%. Overall not a huge upgrade from SE but satisfied with the product.Apple watch is the best on the market hands down by fRGreat watch. Delivered quickly by Best Buy.  Easy ordering online. 
It was quick to setup with my iPhone and looking forward to using Fitness+I really like this watch, it’s great size and very handy.Love it better than my old one. Battery lasts longerEverything great except battery. If you use it heavily, fitness tracking 1-2 hours a day, answering calls, many notifications it barely reach evening 8 or 9 pm with 10% battery left. If that works for you then it is ok. I used to track sleep so worn all day long.I have been using iPhone since 2007 and finally, I convinced myself to get myself an Apple Watch, even though I don't see the need for it, I am still pleased with the purchase.Love it upgraded from Apple Watch series 2 to the 7 and WOW if you have an older Apple Watch definitely worth the upgrade and you can even trade your old watch in and save money off purchasing the new Watch with your trade in value…Best Apple Watch to date! I almost didn’t upgrade but I’m so glad I did. The oximeter is very accurate I use it all the time. At first I constantly compared it against two professional oximeter’s, it was crazy accurate. Perfect for a Covid world! The ekg saved my life revealing I had AFIB that I didn’t know I had.I love my Apple Watch, I use it to track sleep and health. This is my third one now.

I like wearing this.Excellent for a smart watch & good for a fitness tracker. The only thing preventing me from giving it an excellent is the battery life.

I didn't have these issues with my Garmin.Awesome. Battery lasts all day. Speaker loud and crisp.Pretty much happy with the watch. For me it's simply an upgrade from Series 5 Iwatch.
Great buy and perfect compatibility for all iPhonesGreat watch. Does what an Apple Watch is supposed to do.Jumped from series 2 to this one, it is awesome. I love the Nike facesI'm not an Apple fan, always preferred Samsung phones would love to get the new flip phone.  But I love my apple watch so much that I won't switch. I had an iWatch 4 for a few years and really scratched up and eventually broke the screen, so I needed to upgrade.  I wouldn't have done it otherwise.I’ve had the series 5 for a while and the bigger screen makes a big difference! I also like the battery life.Awesome watch- Apple finally delivers a computer watchGreat product, i love the difference between this series and the previous one, It feels so much better, its faster.LOVE my Series 7 Apple Watch. I upgraded from the Series 2, so it was easy to impress; however, I would strongly recommend this watch to anyone regardless of the model they own.First, I love the color. I had another brand fitness watch that I really liked but this one is awesome and I love it.Absolutely love and use this watch everyday. Never goes unused like my old Samsung watch that seemed more trouble than it was worth. Now I’m back to interacting and loving every second I have with this thingVery nice and multipurpose item to own not only time but many other very useful tasks .Great watch! Lots of nice features that works well with your phone.helps me answering my calls and reading my messagesCool ikjjiokisidjejdidjeiejshdy HhxxhhsduuxhxhxhxhxhWaited long enough and am impressed with the extra options tied to heart rate, blood oxygen etc.
However, a bit disappointed with the lack of faces and additional face optionsExtremely easy and fast.. screen very bright and clearly visible in most condition.Upgraded from series 5 which I gave to my fiancé for Christmas. Same quality as before with a larger screen area and oxygen sensor. Seems a bit faster but overall I live this watch as much as my last. Highly recommendGreat price and quality. No wait as they had it on hand.This watch may have saved my life. It registered an irregular heartbeat. I was able to get to my doctors in time to diagnose Atrial Fibulation. We are in the process of getting it correctedGot the Nike version and not because it breathable sports band and a few more faceplates.  This is a very good watch.
Mom loves it it fun helpful when she works it can get wet so its goodLove the new series 7. Best so far. Apple finally got it perfectGreat watch the best they have made so far!!! I definitely recommend this watchGreat watch. I bought it as a grad gift to my son. He loves it so much.The best gift to give someone. He loves it so much!I purchased 2 of these for my sons as gifts.  Impressed with the technology.  Unfortunately, as with many new Apple items, the charging cord was no longer fitted with a USB plug.  Had to by a new charging adapter that accepts the new type plug that came with the watches.  Nobody told me about this change at the time of purchase.  The watches could not be charged on xmas day using my iphone charger.Dont regret it. Best i watch ever, fits perfect and looks  niceGreat watch works as expected I like the Nike appsI like the watch so much, my cad bought for me on my birthdaysDoes everything a regular apple watch does with nike run club preinstalled and a couple nike watch faces.I bought my husband the new Apple Watch 7 for Christmas and decided I needed one for myself. I love the new larger screen and the Nike sport watch band. Great watch for everyday wear.AMAZING, This Apple Watch hasn’t failed me, it does take some getting to use to if you never had a smart watch like myself but it will be amazing once you learnI bought this for bigger screen and AOI feature, I'd say it meets all my expectation, 100% recommend.Absolutely love this watch the only thing is the white watch band gets dingy looking after a while, 
Just a reason to have more than one ! LolIt is the best watch that I have seen so far, I really like itLove it, more comfortable & easy to use, overall excellentGreat watch & screen much bigger! Upgraded from Nike series2 well worth it!Great watch! Wrist band doesn’t get sweaty. Very breathable. Watch itself does everything it says it should do. Solid investmentI had a Apple Watch five Series and I figured it was time to update to the seven I really enjoyed my watch I love all Apple's productsMy first smartwatch, I love it! The only thing I wish that music would play straight from the watch, but you can only do phone calls.
Apple continues to have consistently great product in their watches. No issues to dateRetired my Apple Watch 4 series and upgraded to this. No regrats.Not much of a difference compared to the standard watch, barring a few exclusive faces etc. that are only with the nike edition.
Value depends on how actively you use the watch as a companion device, most people will go through the whole day without needing to have a watch at all, while you can be a power user with replies, schedules, songs all being managed through the watch.Great  watch, for the same price as the regular series, the nike version has additional watch faces along with the nike run club app pre installed. Highly recommendMy second apple watch, so far amazing and I’m happy!!Excellent product and I really enjoy being able to use it during workouts and all the faces it provides.Big screen is a huge improvement over series 4 Nike watch!  Better functionality when texting and better battery life.  Buy and you won’t be disappointed.Dependable, useful, great. Even no long last batteryWorks great. Switched over from my Samsung galaxy watch.This watch is great. All apple products in general, but i really like this one.Best watch to date last pretty much 2 days. Great watchGreat watch. I am using daily and it is a must buy. Battery charges faster compared to series 6.

Nice upgrade and love the new big screen! I’ve always wanted the Nike version of the watch and it’s great. Amazing display. Bigger and better.  The battery charges faster.I am amazed by all this watch does. I was skeptical on purchasing. I didn't think I would like or use it. I was totally wrong. It is awesome. I would recommend this to everyone.Love the watch so far I upgraded from a series 4 to a series 7 and it’s worth it.
My second Apple Watch but not my last.  Love it for the safety measures built in.  Now I have servers 7 but I’ll be there for 8, 9, and beyonfpd.Easy watch to sync. my son loves this

I wish it had come with the adapterComing from a series 1 to this was a crazy good improvement! Much much speedier and I love the bigger screen. Not that interested in the health features. I do enjoy the always on display.Jumped to this from a Series 5.  Faster and the battery does seem to last longer and that's a GREAT thing!  Love the quicker charging and the Nike extra faces are pretty sweet!This has to be the best smart watch on the market. Better than any other brad and out thereLove apple product! Love the bigger screen! The best watch and I don’t wear any other watch.Bought this watch to assist me with my path to a healthier life style!!Love it, first I-watch and took a little while to get used to it.Excellent watch, love the battery life and o2 sensorGreat product!

Best upgrade. Well worth it.I have a series 3 before. It’s worth the update.The setup was super easy… makes tracking your progress while working out super easy to do… moved from the series 2 42mm to this one and the extra 3mm makes a diff for sure
Great watch!! I’ve always used Apple Watch and this watch is greatHad the get this particular model for this particular band. Well worth it.Love the watch and the screen is awesome!

The battery life will be better the new type C is fast to fast chargeOverall a great watch and sleek design.

It seems more sensitive to my movements then my previous Apple Watch.The Apple Watch 7 is nice. Especially if you are upgrading from a version that is several years old.
But beware, it only comes with a charger that is USB C. So if you don’t already have a usb power brick or old Watch charger, you have to buy that and won’t be able to charge your watchWas looking for a watch for my daughter, she had the iwatch 3 and it was time for an upgrade… Great watch highly recommendEl nuevo Apple Watch series 7 de 45mm edición Nike /)Great watch. Just upgraded and it was the best decision I made.Upgraded from an older one and it was with it with the features and facesGreat Product. I mostly use it for running and keeping up with daily activities to ensure I am mostly active. It works really well with the IphoneBought this for my wife the Apple Watch series 7 is awesomeTraded in my series 5 for this one.  Love the bigger display.
AWesome works awesome my husband has always been an Android man and he finally converted over to Iphone and he's loving this new gadget definitely recommend!I really like this watch..so many pluses. So versatile.- this watch is everything I needed and more. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. The bouncing Nike logos are perfect. And the fact that it can launch Nike Run App with just a touch, is amazing. I’m still not sure how I lived without it. The walkie-talkie feature is nice, I can keep in touch with my spouse even when we are far away. Yes texting and phone calls can be done, but where’s the fun in that. I also find that I am using Siri more often, with my watch. And also the audio messages I can send are much easier. Such a top tier feature the ability to type on the watch keyboard.  It’s even funner when both you and your spouse or friend have the Apple Watch, because you can easily send them a lil tap to let you know that you miss them.  And if none of that was enough to convince you to buy it, then I’m not sure what is. The watch is sexy, the band is sexy, so simple and fun to use.Great watch. We had a problem with the shipment. Customer service helped us and got our watch to us on time for ChristmasGreat watch.  Very easy to pair and use with my phone. Will buy again.This is again amazing product from Apple!!! Really liked it. Battery backup is better and screen size difference is visible.Using this since day one! Be careful if you do not have a screen protector cause it does scratch!Super cool great watch looks really nice highly recommend!This is the watch that does it all! A must buy. Great for health conscious people.Love this Watch Apple products are the best 100!!!Functional and comfortable. Very nice on the eyes as wellGreat product. Exactly what you would expect when dealing with an apple product.love this watch i run all the time with it and look at it to muchLoving the watch, I don't leave home without it its very useful.Aye man hands down this doesn’t need a review the watch speaks for itselfLove my Apple Watch. My 4th one I’ve had and they get better every time I upgrade. Can’t go wrong with themNice quality, excellent performance, worth its valueThis is a great watch.  Functions amazing with the iPhone.  The only downfall is with the GPS.  I am a runner and the GPS distances are very far off compared to the Garmin, my vehicle and map my run.Get addition to my workout tracking

Rest, 5/5Love the watch and would recommend. The large screen is great.Seems to glitch here and there , I am having to put my pass code in again even after wearing it for an hourNot what I need lol but ok !! Looks ok Tbh !!!!!!!!Great watch seams to do everything. I feel like it is over priced watchPretty much the 6 with a few extras.  Still a solid watch. I have the 6 and only upgraded because my son wanted an Apple Watch.The watch is going to be great but had some problems shipping at firstThis is my first Apple Watch, I had owned for almost a month. I like it a lot, I am obsessed with closing my circles every day. It’s a very easy to use watch. I do have one complaint though but it’s not Apple’s fault, it’s Nike’s fault. I bought this watch mainly because I thought I could have my Nike Running App Guided Running Plans in the watch, but to my dismay no, that can not be possible. I do have access to the Guided Runs but that’s not what I wanted. I thought that since the watch is a Nike Apple Watch it all would sync like a charm but no. I got hold of a Nike elite tech advisor and he told me that at the moment that was not possible, that I would have to start the guided plan on the phone app and the watch would record the time , pace, heart rate etc. So my plan to leave the phone behind on my runs wasn’t going to work. I thought that it would work like my Garmin watch, on that watch I can save my running  plans and just press start on watch and go, no phone required. I almost returned the  watch just because of this, but at the end I keep it. It does have a lot of features that are fun and actually productive. All I have to keep in mind is even though is advertised as a “ running or working out “ watch, is not a dedicated running watch, I have owned several Garmin and Polar watches so I know what a running or multi sports watch can do. I would keep running with my Garmin on one wrist and the  on the other, got to close those circles hehe. Bottom line, the  watch is a fun tiny extension of my iPhone with lots little things to do with it. It is a smart watch no doubt about I just wish it was more hard core active. Because as it is there’s virtually no difference between the Nike model and the regular  model, none whatsoever.Great upgrade.  I took off one star because the white band clashes with the color of the watch.Apple Watch Nike Series 7 (GPS)  45 mm Midnight Aluminum Case with Anthracite/Black Nike Sport Band
The watch was in good condition and great for a gift. Although, there is no sound that comes out of it (no it’s not on mute) and I had sent it Apple, just for them to tell me that there is nothing wrong with it.Apple couldn’t get my order right but Best Buy made it happen.Nice Watch but not worth the upgrade from series 6!Great new midnight blue color. Bigger screen and now can read more from watch!Good enough watch, does what it's supposed to, nothing spectacularI like to monitor my heart bit and any changes that will notify meThis was my first ever Apple Watch purchase. I was a little skeptical at first because my watch kept going dead very fast and I thought about returning it right away, but now it holds a charge all day.Great watch but very disappointed that the charger did not work. Since there is nowhere in Bozeman MT to buy Apple products, we had to purchase a generic from Walmart. This was a gift. My daughter still loves the watch.I love all the new features of this Nike Series 7 Apple Watch! Bigger face surface for easier readability and access to apps. New face designs are great and Nike integrations make tracking activity fun.The only complaint I have is the battery need to be charged every 24 hours or less.Love the watch, I hold a Best Buy credit card and so far am happy with it. Best Buy does a good job with shipping and prices -for brand new items- 
          As far as the Apple Watch, it is what it is, you buy them knowing there’s going to be a cooler one out in a year. Honestly, I’m kinda disappointed Apple hasn’t implemented a circular design yet. But I am happy with this watch, it displays a lot of information at the glance of a wrist. But, like I said, there’s always a cooler one around the corner. For example, next generation Apple Watches should have blood sugar sensors, and possibly a design rework. 
          It’s a little bit different with a new phone coming out every year when compared to a new Apple Watch coming every year. Because Apple adds, and very well withholds, new technology for future models. 
          That being said, the blood oxygen, heart beat sensor, and new EKG capabilities all work great. Though, I am looking forward to being able to monitor blood sugar health with new generations, as I’m sure a lot of diabetics are probably excited for this technology to appear as well.battery easy to discharge- good only for 1 day- omyIt’s a great watch but needs a longer battery life like my Fitbit, it lasted twice as longThis watch is perfect for me. The battery performance is not great. You will need to charge this watch daily if you use most of the highlighted feature of this phone. I do think it is  overpriced and I am happy that I got it at a discounted price. I am impressed with the screen size and the many watch bands.This watch is great and is the best one I have owned! I'm a nurse and can't always have my phone out and one of the major things I love about this watch is that I can actually type out a message unlike the others where you would have to scribble out a message. Love this watch! I should have bought a screen protector or bumper for the watch though because it does scratch easily.It’s a nice watch, I really like it, I just hope it also have a blood pressure measurementOverall the Apple Watch Series 7 Nike is amazing.  I returned the Starlight color and replaced with Midnight.  The Starlight had to much gold in the silver, which is very pretty looking but not what I was looking for as I wanted either true Silver or Black.  So just noting that in case you want a silver Apple Watch, this one is quite different from Series 6, but is aptly named and does represent starlight.Not the biggest difference from the 5 or 6. So might as well get an older model for cheaper.  Or keeping Im your older watch.Poor i got scammed by best buy. Product missing and no response by the teamI've been hooked on Fitbit as a fitness tracker for the past 10 years, I have been an iPhone user for the past 12 years and casual MacBook user and really still struggled with the decision to move over to this Apple system. I tried an older Apple watch years ago and it just didn't do enough on the heath side to warrant the switch. When the 7 came out and a lot of the health / fitness features were improved i decided to give it a shot again since my Fitbit was smashed. Ultimately I am glad I did. 
The configuration can be a little time consuming, getting everything to talk to one another but ultimately I'm happy with the switch. 
The fitness tracking is not as robust as the Fitbit but the majority of what a non hardcore fitness enthusiast needs is there.
The ONLY thing that really drives me nuts is no built in continuous heart rate capabilities. There are some third party apps but they are not great overall.
Battery life is better than expected but i turned off the always on feature. That gets me about 2 days worth of battery. One day with it on. I just make it habit of charging it when i get to work so i can wear it to sleep and get sleep stats.
It was beyond time to upgrade my old Apple Watch and since my eyesight is getting worse, I decided to go with the larger watch face and I'm glad I did.  It makes it more user-friendly for me.  I really like the new health features of the Series 7.  Very happy with this watch.Apple watches have established a nice legacy of quality, timely updates, increasing features and being very very simple to use.  I have owned Apple watches since the day Series 1 came out.  This watch is no exception.  The series 7 continues very nicely on that legacy.It’s the most expensive Apple Watch, but also the best one. The SE was nice, but had a noticeably smaller screen, and I kind of wanted the Always On Display that the 6 and the 7 series have.
In addition, the battery lasts a little longer, and I liked the Nike band that came on this model. Saved me some money on getting one after the fact.
What really surprised me was how good this watch makes good old fashioned phone calls. The call quality is impressive and it’s so much more convenient than holding an iPhone 13 ProMax in my hand. Lol
I’m super impressed!I returned it because it was a duplicate gift. They said I would get a refund in 5 business days. It has been over 10 days now. I just want my refund so I don't have to pay that bill and then have to fight to get that money back. They make you jump through hoops and wait forever.Don't ever order anything from best buy! They will double charged you. They double charged me for this Apple watch. Tried to dispute the claim but denied. WOW! I thought social media will be a great place to start making cruel comments about best buy!!!A stylish/preppy watch with many features and faster compared to previous models. Love the ease of sending text messages and making phone calls.Phone was returned because it kept locking up the only way to get it to function was to put it on the chargerSo far so good. Pairs great with my iPhone and has tremendous range away from the phone. Price could be a little lower, but satisfied with my purchase. The O2 monitor is a nice feature. The ECG reading is limited but pretty cool.Be careful if you go with the open box option, this watch wouldn’t turn on or hold a charge out of the box. I had to return it.Constantly restating itself, only had about a month and it resets almost every 15 mins. Known Apple issueLove it!!!  I am sold on apple products and the series 7 did not disappoint.  I previously had a series 3 which I bought several years ago just to try out the apple watch and to see if I would actually wear it, I did so when it was time to upgrade I was excited for the series 7.  I love the fact that I don't have to set it to water proof, it does this on its own.  The O2 function is great and the actual EKG is amazing.Upgraded from Series 3.  Nice improvements of watch face size and features.Beautiful design.  Nice upgrade to my old Iwatch.  Love the upgraded ECG feature.The Apple Watch 7 has all the features that help you stay up to date with your personal health information and goals (which is what I use it for). It's nice to customize the different faces so you see what you want to see when you look at it. I also like that the apps can be seen in a list. The only thing missing is having it take my blood pressure, which I doubt will ever be possible! The only negative is that you do need to find a compatible charger, which can be expensive if you want a stand-type charger that includes your phone. Otherwise, it does take extra long to charge.Had a Fitbit and thought that was ok but this is a huge upgrade. Super easy to use the fitness features. Love the band also.Bought as gift.  Upgrading my wife to the latest version.  She likes the new features and the style of the Nike band.  Good soup.I love the upgrades on the watch. The screen size is way better and easier to see.The new Apple Watch has more features and is easier to navigate than the previous models.Works great! Nice and sleek. Watch is the perfect size and shape.Bought this to track my fitness and it has been very instrumental. Looks great and is very easy to use
Upgraded from Apple Watch Series 6.  For most the upgrade from 6 is probably not worth it; however, I wanted to change from silver to the midnight color—which is a flat black with a tint of blue—very cool.  The 02 and ECG are cool features but I am not using them as much as I thought I would.  My sleep app integrates O2 data which adds another layer of data that I really appreciate.  Love the watch, we’ll done Apple!My Package didn't come in it's saying delivered I can't get in touch with nobody to talk to .This watch is a great upgrade over the previous versions.  Coming from a 4 my favorite feature is the alway on display - but i have also come to appreciate the faster charging which allows you to use the watch for a sleep monitor wearing it 24 hours a day because you can get a near full charge with only 30 minutes of charging.  Overall this is the most solid and comprehensive wearable out on the market today.First time owning an Apple Watch and I love it. Weather, messages, and so many other great features at your fingertips. Also has a feature to ping your phone if you misplace it which is nice.love it!  large UI - water proof - pretty easy to set it up - what else can you ask for - this is my 2nd apple watch - 1st one was a 3rd gen but this series 7 has far better features and im very happy with this purchase.Series 7- awesome watch with great features. The extra feature for medical issues especially AFIB is a real plus.  Great watch to track your workouts charging lasts longer. Really like this watch.Late arrival,supposed to be Christmas present,came afterUpgraded from Series 3.  One thing I love is the full keyboard for texting - this is much easier than drawing each letter out for texting.  I also like the fact if I fall or be injured, it will alert first responders.  The fitness also seems to be more accurate on this watch.A very good watch to own. I had Apple series 1 and upgraded to 7.  It charges very fast and lasts long.  I liked the new features like ECG..Amazing update from Nike Apple Watch 2 to Nike Apple Watch 7!  Absolutely recommend this to anyone who is into tracking fitness.  The battery life is great and this is full featured.I am coming to the Apple Watch Series 7 from the Series 3.  The improvements are stunning as is the accuracy of my calories/steps/mileage workout info.  
I really liked the Nike styling, so I went for it.  It comes at a price, but you're getting quality.Great looking watch and I love the new larger screen. This is my third Apple Watch in the last 5 years and I’m happy to report they are all still working perfectly. I upgrade every couple years just because I want to never because of a problem.Great Best Buy price . Best anywhere .  Very nice watch for my 17 years old . Got it for him because he got straight A’s at schoolStill the best; it has everything you need and more. You need to get one to see what you have been missing all this time. It’s a geek fest, but very friendly to use. Health wise, fitness wise, communication wise, trendy wise: all the top.This is my third Apple Watch and they’ve all worked well. I love the always on display that this features.A great watch for a very fair price.  The help at Best Buy was perfect.Love the bigger screen and new color! Band is awful color but cheap bands are everywhere!Best smart watch out there hands down.

Now with a keyboard it’s easier to send a text message

Love the big screen hate the off silver pink color. I opted for this color as silver aluminum was no longer an option. Once I got it, I noticed immediately how selecting another band was going to be an issue. Now I want a cover. But doesn’t really affect how much I love everything else.Right out of the box this thing rocks. It was easy to set up and is incredibly fast. The screen size is great.Love the larger screen and ease of use during meetings.Super easy to use and great battery life. I have bigger wrists and the 45mm doesn’t look too small.Love this watch.
